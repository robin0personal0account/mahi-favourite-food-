![Mahi's Food Choices](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-Complete-brightgreen)

This adorable web app was created especially for **Mahi** to explore different food choices and save her favorites! Every time Mahi finds a dish she loves, she can save it, and it will be stored in a special Google Sheet just for her. 🌟

## 🌐 Live Demo

Check out the app in action here: [Mahi's Food Choices Demo](https://robin0personal0account.github.io/mahi-favourite-food-/)

## ✨ Features

- 🍕 **Discover Yummy Foods**: Get a random food recipe every time you visit or refresh the page.

- 📱 **Mobile-Friendly**: Works perfectly on all devices, so Mahi can use it on the go!

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Get a Random Dish**: On page load, the app fetches a random food recipe from TheMealDB API and shows it to Mahi.
2. **Make a Choice**:
    - **Want**: If Mahi likes the dish, clicking "Want" will save it to her Google Sheet.
    - **Skip**: Not interested? Click "Skip" to find something else.
3. **Save to Google Sheet**: Mahi's favorite dishes are safely stored in a special Google Sheet.
